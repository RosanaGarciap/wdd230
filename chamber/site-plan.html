        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Roboto Slap  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
          Slap Serif fonts present a good contrast when paired with serif fonts. Roboto Slab font is a good option that provide style, stetic and well spaced distribution
        which made it a good option for easy and readable headings.

      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Inter  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        Inter font was designed to be a secondary typeface for use in paragraph and small UI elements. The design is simple, easy to read and understand, 
        as well as beautiful. Since this website is designed to satify the necesity of both family users and business owners the combination of Roboto Slap
        and Inter provide a style suitable for both professional and familiar users.
