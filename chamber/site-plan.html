      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The goal is help students from 4th to 6th to improve their math skills using three indicators: Average of Hits (showed by the number of acerts and mistakes),
        structure (prox lesson page), and speed (time in give the right answer).<br> 
        Initially, this webpage will shows the IU and latter add the Javascript to calculate basic math operations (addition, subtraction, etc.)
     </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Even when the purpose is help students from 10 to 12 years with their math studies, however, this tools are not restricted to students, they can be used by 
        all public that wish improve their ability calculating math operations.

      <h4>About Easy Math Learning: </h4>
      <p>
        Easy Math Learning is a project destinated to help young students to improve their skills in solving math problems. 
        Our tools are designed to help you to master from basic to complex math operations by using three keys indicators:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Average of Hits:</strong> Naturally, a person knows to solve math problems if can find the right answer. 
            Average of Hits value is given by the number of right answers divided by the number of tries.</li>
          <li><strong>Structure: </strong> When solving problems, reach the right answer is not enough, you must also know 
            “how write” your answers correctly. You can see a set of templates explaining how to solve problems step by step 
            in the section Lessons (coming soon).</li>
          <li><strong>Speed:</strong> while present a test the time becomes a very dangerous enemy. Be able to solve problems 
            within the limit time could determine if you pass or not the test, even if you know how to solve the problem, 
            that’s why to improve your speed every exercise keep a register of the time expended in each problem so you can 
            work to improve it.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How This Work?</h4>
      <p>
        You can improve your time by using our free online calculator tool and timer. Unlike other calculators, this will not 
        return the answer immediately but will wait until the user provides an answer, ones the answer is submitted the timer 
        stops, and the answer is shown.    
      </p>
        <h4>Try Out!</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Write the exercise using the calculator.</li>
          <li>When you are ready press the Start button.</li>
          <li>Write your answer and press Stop button.</li>
          <li>Compare the answers and improve your time.</li>
        </ul>
